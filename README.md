# reproduce

```rm -r dist && yarn build```

i'm not entirely sure what is going on here but have noticed that:
* the issue only occurs when building, not running the dev server
* the issue will happen when importing the default ```React``` package one way but not another

so... take these steps
* demo the project live to see it work: ```yarn start```
* try to build the project in default configuration: ```yarn build``` (you should get the error)
* in ```src/index.jsx``` switch the ```React``` import lines to the following:
  ```
  // // using this import style does not work
  // import React from 'react';

  // but using this import style does...
  import {
    default as React,
  } from 'react';
  ```
* try to build the project again and see success

# consider
in app.jsx ```React``` is imported using the ```import { default as React } from 'react'``` syntax. maybe this is a clue?
